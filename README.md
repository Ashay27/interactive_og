# Interactive Underground3D

This product was developed with the aim to ease the process of planners in design of urban areas. Ultimately aiming to be able to optimise both the below and above ground space. Here the focus was on the below ground and optimising the space to have room for assets that could solve the problems related to climate adaptation, energy transition and urban densification.
